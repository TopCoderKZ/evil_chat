We are using Webpacker gem to build our assets with Webpack while PostCSS and cssnext are processing our styles. Babel, Autoprefixer, and Browserslist allow us not worry about cross-browser issues. Our code is automatically checked for syntax errors with Prettier, AirBnB Base Config, ESLint, and stylelint on each git commit.
